 * Created on: 22/07/2016
 *
 * This file contains the code of a Global Manager capable of controlling a
 * set of managers. It tries to synchronise their calibration phases and to
 * let them run at the same time on the same resources.
 * Since the resources are limited and not all the managers requirements may
 * be satisfied, this global manager tries to be fair and to minimise the
 * disadvantages for each single manager.
 *
 * The rationale is that individual applications can require PERF_* type
 * contracts (would not have sense for individual applications to require
 * POWER_* type contracts in multiprogrammed environment, since it has sense
 * to talk about power cap only at the level of the entire system. If the
 * application is the only one running into the system of course it makes
 * sense to require POWER_* type contracts).
 *
 * On top of the individual contracts by the application, the global manager
 * can add a POWER_* type contract (if power cap is +infinity only the single
 * applications contract will be considered).
